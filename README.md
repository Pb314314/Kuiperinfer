## Kuiperinfer : an inference framework for learners

## Environment Setting

Run Docker_connect.sh to connect to the Docker container. 

Then, connect Visual Studio Code to the Docker container and start working!

### Lab1
Use the armadillo library to compute arma::fmat matrix.
A very easy lab, just use easy operation and arma::exp API.(3/30/2024)

### Lab2
Understand Tensor class.(Use template and Armadillo and design user interface. Implemented the float template specialization)
    
Use Armadillo to store the fcube in class and understand the class functions.

Implemented Padding and Flatten. (4/1/2024) 

### Lab3
Learn about deep learning model **intermediate representation**. 

Learn about pnnx(`ir.cpp`, `ir.hpp`. Created by nihui dalao). Learn about model graph, operators and operands structures. 

Learn about kuiperinfer Runtime representation of graph, operators and operands structures. 

By the way, finished CS6290 Project2 yesterday.(4/7/2024)

Finish `RuntimeGraph::InitGraphParams();`

Modify the `Runtime_Operator.params` from `std::mapping<std::string, Runtime_Parameter>` to `std::mapping<std::string, std::shared_ptr<Runtime_Parameter>>`, and change the test code. (4/8/2024)

(Just found that I was using another Github account when committing. Change to Pb314314 now.)

### Lab4

Review Lab3, understand `Runtime_Operator` better.

Start Lab4, learn about graph topology path and operator output memory allocation.
